# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Building a detection model using a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow & Keras.

Used brain MRI images.

InceptionResNetV2 Model was trained on large dataset which had the brain MRI Images.

## About the data:
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains 253 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 155 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 98 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.
